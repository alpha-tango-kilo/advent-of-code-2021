# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my Rust solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

There are READMEs for each day explaining my approach and any difficulties I had

## To run my solutions

Clone the repository, then assuming Rust is installed on your system, do:

```
cargo run --release -p [day_XX] --bin [part_1 | part_2]
```

Input files are expected to be in the workspace directory, named "input", e.g. `./day_01/input`
