# Day Seven - The Treachery of Whales

[**Link**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7)

## Part one

Another problem which could easily end up with a really inefficient solution.
After yesterday though, I was nervous about efficiency and so chose to keep a frequency map of the crabs, similar to yesterday's technique.
Otherwise, the solution to this problem was fairly easy

## Part two

I recognised the use of triangle numbers quite quickly so was able to use a formula instead of iteratively calculating the fuel need.
The challenge definitely felt like it should have been day 3 for how easy it was
