## Part one

Not a simple task, but at least it's a vaguely fun one.
My checking for winners is very inefficient but oh well it's not like it takes the program a noticeable amount of time to run ðŸ˜‚

## Part two

I thought this was going to be really simple, but it was more of a fun challenge than I expected.
There are a lot of cases you can ignore in the first part (like multiple people winning at once) that you suddenly have to debug not accommodating for.
The changes necessary to make to `GameState` were largely speaking backwards compatible too, so I didn't have to amend my part one solution
