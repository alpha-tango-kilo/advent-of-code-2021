# Day One - Sonar Sweep

## Part one

A nice simple puzzle to kick things off.
Tried to find a nice functional solution to the problem instead of using a for loop and count variables

## Part two

Well part two fitted really nicely into my approach to part one.
Solving the problem with conventional looping iteration would have been a pain.
Lots of zipping today!
