# Day Eleven - Dumbo Octopus

[**Link**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11)

## Part one

Considering how relatively simple the puzzle felt, I'm surprised my solution is this long.
I totally didn't misread the prompt initially and thought octopi were meant to flash at 9

## Part two

Easy enough to adapt to this from part one.
Glad I took the approach of keeping a list of which octopi flashed now (originally I tried to do without), as it made this task nice and easy
