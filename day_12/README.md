# Day Twelve - Passage Pathing

## Part one

It's allocation heavy, messy, ugly, and I thought there was no way in hell it would work - but the bastard got the right answer first time.
So many conflicting emotions

## Part two

To expand on the first part, going into part two barely understanding my own part one solution was... interesting.
I have to put some more structure to the problem in order to do part two (hence the creation of `Route`) but ultimately it is still a heavy solution.
Having so many more possibilities made the run time of this one noticeably slow, though thankfully not an infeasible amount of time.
With release optimisations and a purely single-threaded solution, my program produces the correct answer in ~45 seconds.
There are definitely measures I could take to improve this I think, but the important part is I got the right answer and understand my code better now.
I was very afraid when I started getting the wrong answer and thus needed to try and debug the code I understood very poorly, but I got there in the end
