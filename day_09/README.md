# Day Nine - Smoke Basin

## Part one

I made this part harder for myself by deciding that I wasn't going to be a wimp and use `ndarray` and instead roll my one 1-dimensional `Vec` pretending to be a 2D array.
This would have been alright if I hadn't also made really poorly designed tests that didn't fail when I got my co-ordinates mixed up (by having square arrays, it was a lot easier to be correct).
However after copious painful debugging we are now all goodâ„¢

## Part two

I hate to admit defeat but for now I have to.
All of the tests I've written pass, the code is doing exactly what I expect it to.
There must be some strange edge case that only occurs in the bigger data set that sends something wonky.
I've thought of an alternative approach but I don't have the energy right now.
Shall be taking the loss on this one unless I get a glut of spare time during another day
