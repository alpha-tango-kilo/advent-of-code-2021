# Day Fifteen - Chiton

[**Link**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15)

## Part one

This is some hella dodgy solution.
There is something deeply botched but I can still get the right solution out of it.
So long as it doesn't flop awfully on part two I will probably not bother diagnosing it as I have spent so many hours on this challenge already

## Part two

Okay yeah it didn't work, I'll pass on this one unless I get way too much time on my hands.
Please enjoy my absurdly inefficient grid upscaling methodology
