# Day Ten - Syntax Scoring

[**Link**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10)

## Part one

This looked like a fun one, and it was fortunately!
Really happy with my solution here, feels very idiomatic

## Part two

Interesting task, easy enough to adapt from the initial naive parsing implementation.
Made it suitably generic so that both part one and two could use the same parsing function.
Nice to have a day that was a bit easier than the previous two ðŸ˜…
